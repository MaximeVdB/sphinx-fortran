# Warning

This sphinx-fortran fork is not exactly pretty --
compared to upstream, it basically adds a bunch
of ad-hoc changes to make it work for a particular
code that follows the Fortran >= 2003 standard.

A decent sphinx extension for (modern) Fortran would
require an almost complete rewrite of sphinx-fortran,
as well as numpy.f2py.crackfortran.
